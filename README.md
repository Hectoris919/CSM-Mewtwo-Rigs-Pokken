### Just a port for Clip Studio Paint of all the Mewtwo models from Pokken

You can change the mouths on each rig by changeing their face in the Faces dropdown in CSP. You can also change the eye and eyelids in the Expression Settings dropdown. You can also add or remove teeth in the Hair dropdown.

### KNOWN ISSUES

There's a gap between the mouth and neck if you lean the head back. This cannot be fixed within reason.

If you bend either of the mega mewtwo's hands back, their forarm ridge clips into itself slightly. This can be fixed within reason but im extremely lazy and have chosen not to.
