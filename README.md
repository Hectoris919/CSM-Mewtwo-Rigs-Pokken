Just a port for Clip Studio Paint of all Mewtwo models from Pokken
</h2>

You can change the mouths on each rig by changeing their face in the Faces dropdown in CSP. You can also change the eye and eyelids in the Expression Settings dropdown. You can also add or remove teeth in the Hair dropdown.

KNOWN ISSUES
</h1>

1. There's a gap between the mouth and neck if you lean the head back. This cannot be fixed within reason.

2. Because of the way the eyes are set up, sometimes gaps will appear on the models at certain angles.
Shadow Mega Mewtwo has large gaps in his eyes compared to the other models, as can be seen below

3. If you bend either of the mega mewtwo's hands back, their forarm ridge clips into itself slightly. This can be fixed within reason but im extremely lazy and have chosen not to.
